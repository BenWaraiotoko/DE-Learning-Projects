**10-month data engineering learning roadmap (Jan-Oct 2026) with 32 hands-on projects building to Le Wagon bootcamp entry.**

**Monthly progression:**

- **Jan-Feb:** Docker foundations + Airflow orchestration (6 projects: containers, PostgreSQL, DAGs, error handling)
- **Mar:** dbt transformations + integration (3 projects: models, tests, Airflow-dbt pipeline)
- **Apr:** Scaling tools (3 projects: PySpark, Kubernetes/minikube, portfolio polish)
- **May:** Capstone - Fukuoka Weather ETL (production-quality pipeline: API extraction, Airflow orchestration, dbt transformations, Docker deployment, tests, CI/CD)
- **Jun-Oct:** Interview prep, Le Wagon application, acceptance, prework completion, final polish

**Structure:** Each project scoped 4-8 hours with specific stack, deliverables, GitHub repos, and commit targets. Parallel Codecademy track (Python → SQL → Pandas → Data Wrangling).

**Output:** 9-11 GitHub repos demonstrating progression from "Hello Docker" to production ETL. Total investment: 350-400 hours over 10 months at 10-12h/week.

**Execution model:** Weekly check-ins to break down current project into exact steps, code templates, and review cycles.
